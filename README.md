### A&M Shopping Brand Website

Welcome to the A&M Shopping Brand website repository! This project utilizes React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Firebase for the backend to create a scalable and efficient e-commerce platform.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdimado/aandmfashion.com.git
   cd aandmfashion.com
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase:**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Obtain your Firebase config credentials.
   - Add your Firebase config to `src/firebase/firebaseConfig.js`.

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash

- **`assets/`**: Contains static assets such as images, icons, or other media used in the project.

- **`components/`**: Houses reusable React components used throughout the website, such as `Header`, `RecipeCard`, `RecipeForm`, etc.

- **`custom-hooks/`**: Holds custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic, such as fetching data from Firebase or handling form state.
